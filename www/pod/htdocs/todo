reorganize worker.cgi to make it more consistant
make the login screen look prettier
make some links change color rather than underline when hover so there isnt a strange space underlined next to an icon
move the checkbox next to each channel on the subscribe page up so the description can take up the full width
make a button to play the next episode you havent listened to if you dont have one to resume
make a button on the listen page to save and pause
make the section start unfolded if you are only subscribed to 1 channel
